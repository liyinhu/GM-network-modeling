# GM-network-modeling
Gut microbiota (GM) is a micro-ecosystem formed by a large number of microorganisms through competition and cooperation. The project constructs a complex network-based GM modeling approach to evaluate the topological features of the GM micro-ecosystem and provides computational simulations for users to infer the window period and bacterial candidates for GM intervention during disease progression. There are three major parts concluded in the program.
* Stability assessment  
* Vulnerability assessment  
* Robustness assessment
