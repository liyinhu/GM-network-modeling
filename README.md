# GM-network-modeling
Gut microbiota (GM) is a micro-ecosystem formed by a large number of microorganisms through competition and cooperation. The project constructs a complex network-based GM modeling approach to evaluate the topological features of the GM micro-ecosystem and provides computational simulations for users to infer the window period and bacterial candidates for GM intervention during disease progression. There are three major parts concluded in the program.
* Stability assessment  
* Vulnerability assessment  
* Robustness assessment
# Thetory
Before evaluating the stability of the GM networks, we first detect the effect of the nodes in a network by adopting the abundance-weighted mean interaction strength (*wMIS_i*) index. The *wMIS_i* index can be calculated for each node in a network with the following formula.
